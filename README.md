- Enhanced reverse engineering workflow with AI assistance
- Support for every MCP client (Cline, Claude desktop, Roo Code, etc.)
- Open multiple binaries and switch the active target automatically

## Examples

### Solving a CTF Challenge

Check out [this demo video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ffMHH39L_M) that uses the extension to solve a CTF challenge.

## Components

This repository contains two separate components:

1. A Binary Ninja plugin that provides an MCP server that exposes Binary Ninja's capabilities through HTTP endpoints. This can be used with any client that implements the MCP protocol.
2. A separate MCP bridge component that connects your favorite MCP client to the Binary Ninja MCP server.

## Prerequisites

- [Binary Ninja](https://binary.ninja/)
- Python 3.12+
- MCP client (those with auto-setup support are listed below)

## Installation

### MCP Client

Please install the MCP client before you install Binary Ninja MCP so that the MCP clients can be auto-setup. We currently support auto-setup for these MCP clients:

    1. Cline (recommended)
    2. Roo Code
    3. Claude Desktop (recommended)
    4. Cursor
    5. Windsurf
    6. Claude Code
    7. LM Studio

### Extension Installation

After the MCP client is installed, you can install the MCP server using the Binary Ninja Plugin Manager or manually. Both methods support auto-setup of MCP clients.

If your MCP client is not set, you should install it first then try to reinstall the extension.

#### Binary Ninja Plugin Manager

You may install the extension through Binary Ninja's Plugin Manager (`Plugins > Manage Plugins`).

#### Manual Install

To manually install the extension, this repository can be copied into the [Binary Ninja plugins folder](https://docs.binary.ninja/guide/plugins.html).

### [Optional] Manual Setup of the MCP Client

*You do NOT need to set this up manually if you use a supported MCP client and follow the installation steps before.*

You can also manage MCP client entries from the command line:

```bash
python scripts/mcp_client_installer.py --install    # auto setup supported MCP clients
python scripts/mcp_client_installer.py --uninstall  # remove entries and delete `.mcp_auto_setup_done`
python scripts/mcp_client_installer.py --config     # print a generic JSON config snippet
```

#### Using npm package (Recommended)

The recommended way to set up the MCP client is using the official npm package:

```bash
npx -y binary-ninja-mcp
```

For MCP clients, use this configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "binary-ninja-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "binary-ninja-mcp", "--host", "localhost", "--port", "9009"]
    }
  }
}
```

Or if installed globally:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "binary-ninja-mcp": {
      "command": "binary-ninja-mcp",
      "args": ["--host", "localhost", "--port", "9009"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Using Python Bridge (Legacy)

For other MCP clients, use the Python bridge directly:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "binary_ninja_mcp": {
            "command": "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/Binary Ninja/plugins/repositories/community/plugins/fosdickio_binary_ninja_mcp/.venv/bin/python",
            "args": [
                "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/Binary Ninja/plugins/repositories/community/plugins/fosdickio_binary_ninja_mcp/bridge/binja_mcp_bridge.py"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Note: Replace `/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO` with the actual absolute path to your project directory. The virtual environment's Python interpreter must be used to access the installed dependencies.

## Usage

1. Open Binary Ninja and load a binary
2. Click the button shown at left bottom corner
3. Start using it through your MCP client

You may now start prompting LLMs about the currently open binary (or binaries). Example prompts:

### CTF Challenges

```txt
You're the best CTF player in the world. Please solve this reversing CTF challenge in the <folder_name> folder using Binary Ninja. Rename ALL the function and the variables during your analyzation process (except for main function) so I can better read the code. Write a python solve script if you need. Also, if you need to create struct or anything, please go ahead. Reverse the code like a human reverser so that I can read the decompiled code that analyzed by you.
```

### Malware Analysis

```txt
Your task is to analyze an unknown file which is currently open in Binary Ninja. You can use the existing MCP server called "binary_ninja_mcp" to interact with the Binary Ninja instance and retrieve information, using the tools made available by this server. In general use the following strategy:

- Start from the entry point of the code
- If this function call others, make sure to follow through the calls and analyze these functions as well to understand their context
- If more details are necessary, disassemble or decompile the function and add comments with your findings
- Inspect the decompilation and add comments with your findings to important areas of code
- Add a comment to each function with a brief summary of what it does
- Rename variables and function parameters to more sensible names
- Change the variable and argument types if necessary (especially pointer and array types)
- Change function names to be more descriptive, using mcp_ as prefix.
- NEVER convert number bases yourself. Use the convert_number MCP tool if needed!
- When you finish your analysis, report how long the analysis took
- At the end, create a report with your findings.
- Based only on these findings, make an assessment on whether the file is malicious or not.
```

| `set_function_prototype(name_or_address, prototype)`                 | Set a function's prototype by name or address.                                                               |
| `patch_bytes(address, data, save_to_file)`                           | Patch raw bytes at an address (byte-level, not assembly). Can patch entire instructions by providing their bytecode. Address: hex (e.g., "0x401000") or decimal. Data: hex string (e.g., "90 90"). `save_to_file` (default True) saves to disk and re-signs on macOS. |

These are the list of HTTP endpoints that can be called:

- `/decompile?name=<func>&lang=<hlil|pseudoc>`: Decompile a function. `lang=hlil` (default) returns HLIL with intrinsics preserved; `lang=pseudoc` returns C-like Pseudo C rendering.
- `/decompileToFile?name=<func>&outputPath=<path>&lang=<hlil|pseudoc>`: Decompile a function and save to a file. Same `lang` options as `/decompile`.
- `/il?name=<func>&view=<hlil|mlil|llil>&ssa=<0|1>`: Get IL for a function in the selected view.
- `/saveBndb?outputPath=<path>`: Save the analysis database as a `.bndb` file.
- `/allStrings`: All strings in one response.
- `/formatValue?address=<addr>&text=<value>&size=<n>`: Convert and set a comment at an address.
- `/getXrefsTo?address=<addr>`: Xrefs to address (code+data).
- `/getDataDecl?name=<symbol>|address=<addr>&length=<n>`: JSON with declaration-style string and a hexdump for a data symbol or address. Keys: `address`, `name`, `size`, `type`, `decl`, `hexdump`. `length < 0` reads exact defined size if available.
- `/hexdump?address=<addr>&length=<n>`: Text hexdump aligned at address; `length < 0` reads exact defined size if available.
- `/hexdumpByName?name=<symbol>&length=<n>`: Text hexdump by symbol name. Recognizes BN auto-labels like `data_<hex>`, `byte_<hex>`, `word_<hex>`, `dword_<hex>`, `qword_<hex>`, `off_<hex>`, `unk_<hex>`, and plain hex addresses.
- `/makeFunctionAt?address=<addr>&platform=<name|default>`: Create a function at an address (idempotent if already exists). `platform=default` uses the BinaryView/platform default.
- `/platforms`: List all available platform names.
- `/binaries` or `/views`: List managed/open binaries with ids and active flag.
- `/selectBinary?view=<id|filename>`: Select active binary for subsequent operations.
- `/data?offset=<n>&limit=<m>&length=<n>`: Defined data items with previews. `length` controls bytes read per item (capped at defined size). Default behavior reads exact defined size when available; `length=-1` forces exact-size.
- `/getXrefsToEnum?name=<enum>`: Enum usages by matching member constants.
- `/getXrefsToField?struct=<name>&field=<name>`: Xrefs to struct field.
- `/getXrefsToType?name=<type>`: Xrefs/usages related to a struct/type name.
- `/getTypeInfo?name=<type>`: Resolve a type and return declaration and details.
- `/getXrefsToUnion?name=<union>`: Union xrefs/usages (members, globals, refs).
- `/getStackFrameVars?name=<function>|address=<addr>`: Get stack frame variable information for a function.
- `/getCallers?identifiers=<name|addr>[,...]`: Return caller summaries (functions, call sites, HLIL/IL snippets) for one or more identifiers. Accepts `identifiers`, `identifier`, `names`, or `addresses` query params.
- `/getCallees?identifiers=<name|addr>[,...]`: Return callee summaries with the same schema as `/getCallers`, detailing every outgoing call target per request identifier.
- `/localTypes?offset=<n>&limit=<m>`: List local types.
- `/strings?offset=<n>&limit=<m>`: Paginated strings.
- `/strings/filter?offset=<n>&limit=<m>&filter=<substr>`: Filtered strings.
- `/searchTypes?query=<substr>&offset=<n>&limit=<m>`: Search local types by substring.
- `/patch` or `/patchBytes?address=<addr>&data=<hex>&save_to_file=<bool>`: Patch raw bytes at an address (byte-level, not assembly). Can patch entire instructions by providing their bytecode. Address: hex (e.g., "0x401000") or decimal. Data: hex string (e.g., "90 90"). `save_to_file` (default True) saves to disk and re-signs on macOS.
- `/renameVariables`: Batch rename locals in a function. Parameters:
  - Function: one of `functionAddress`, `address`, `function`, `functionName`, or `name`.
  - Provide renames via one of:
    - `renames`: JSON array of `{old, new}` objects
    - `mapping`: JSON object of `old->new`
    - `pairs`: compact string `old1:new1,old2:new2`
          Returns per-item results plus totals. Order is respected; later pairs can refer to earlier new names.

## Development

### Code Quality

This project uses [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and formatting. Configuration is in `ruff.toml`.

#### Running Ruff Manually

Check for issues:
```bash
ruff check .
```

Auto-fix issues:
```bash
ruff check --fix .
```

Check formatting issues:
```bash
ruff format --check .
```

Format code:
```bash
ruff format .
```

#### GitHub Actions

A GitHub Action workflow (`.github/workflows/lint-format.yml`) automatically runs Ruff on:

- Every push to the `main` branch
- Every pull request targeting the `main` branch

The workflow will fail if there are linting errors or formatting issues, ensuring code quality in CI.
